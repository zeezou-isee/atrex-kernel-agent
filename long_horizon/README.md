# Episode supervisor internals

This package implements the native optimization engine used by
`orchestrator/optimize.py`. It is not a separate command-line entry point.

Each canonical optimization version is explored in an isolated Git branch and worktree. A coding
agent may run multiple related profile/research/edit/validate cycles, preserve private checkpoint
commits, and finally publish one structured handoff: `candidate_ready`, `pivot`, or `blocked`.

The supervisor validates the journal and candidate commit, checks production policy, and evaluates
incumbent and candidate in an exact same-allocation ABBA schedule. A strict correctness-passing
improvement is squash-promoted to the incumbent; every other outcome records canonical
`memory/vN.json` evidence without changing the incumbent kernel.

An episode candidate commit contains only `kernel.py`. Plans, profiles, planner discussions,
journals, and handoffs stay uncommitted and are copied into the episode archive before the isolated
worktree is removed.

Runtime state lives under `.atrex_long_horizon/` in generated campaign workspaces. Public options
such as `--handoff-resumes`, `--verify-repeats`, `--verify-run-timeout`, and
`--min-improvement-pct` are parsed directly by `orchestrator/optimize.py`.

Each active episode also exposes ignored `memory/live.json`. It is initialized immediately and
atomically refreshed after every journal append, but it never participates in version selection or
promotion; `memory/vN.json` remains the canonical supervisor-owned record.

Every canonical record carries a compact copy of all structured experiments already persisted in
the episode journal. If the supervisor is terminated while an episode is active, the next startup
resumes the registered episode worktree in place, including its source edits, checkpoints, journal,
plans, profiles, and generated intermediate files. If that worktree is missing or no longer matches
the recorded branch and baseline, recovery falls back to archiving it and recording an
`interrupted` `memory/vN.json`. Recovery remains idempotent across repeated termination.

Claude and Codex can resume the same session to repair an incomplete handoff; Qoder and Pi use a
single long invocation. Codex token deltas and marker ordering are read incrementally from the
resumable native rollout. Available invocation components must reconcile with cumulative rollout and
`turn.completed` totals before attribution. Reconciled events may form one phase interval across a
resume boundary. If ledger observation fails, consecutive cumulative stdout usage still supplies a
non-duplicated invocation total while phase attribution degrades fail-closed.

## Module responsibilities

- `campaign.py`: episode budgets, recovery, terminal-state processing, and promotion decisions.
- `git_episode.py`: private branch/worktree lifecycle, protected-path checks, squash promotion,
  and canonical outcome commits.
- `session.py`: one long coding-agent invocation plus bounded same-thread recovery for Claude and
  Codex.
- `journal.py` and `protocol.py`: atomic journal/handoff I/O and terminal validation.
- `verifier.py` and `remote_abba.py`: one-allocation incumbent/candidate ABBA execution.
- `store.py` and `telemetry.py`: restart state, archived attempts, and best-effort episode metrics.

`.atrex_long_horizon/state.json` and `active_episode.json` are restart state, while each
`episodes/eNNNN/` directory archives the prompt, journal-derived attempt, worktree snapshot,
verification payload, and telemetry available for that episode. These files are intentionally
excluded from campaign commits. Accepted evidence is also written to committed
`memory/long_horizon_eNNNN.json` and the canonical `memory/v<N>.json`.

At process termination the orchestrator writes an ignored
`trace-retention-manifest.json`. It declares only the candidate sources,
canonical memory, episode journals and evaluations, Wiki query events, and
compact profiler reports needed for offline knowledge extraction. It explicitly
does not declare coding-agent session JSONL, stdout/stderr logs, temporary
worktrees, caches, or bulk profiler captures. A deployment hook may use this
manifest as producer evidence, but remains responsible for path validation,
secret scanning, archive limits, transport, and retry.
