## B300 vs B200 Key Differences

| FP4 Peak (dense) | 15,000 TFLOPS (15 PFLOPS) | 9,000 TFLOPS (9 PFLOPS) | +67% |
| FP4 Peak (sparse) | 20,000 TFLOPS (20 PFLOPS) | 18,000 TFLOPS (18 PFLOPS) | +11% |
| FP16/BF16 Tensor | 2,250 TFLOPS | 2,250 TFLOPS | Same |
| FP8 Tensor | 4,500 TFLOPS | 4,500 TFLOPS | Same |

> **Design Philosophy**: B300 sacrifices FP64 throughput to reallocate die area and power budget towards FP4 Tensor Core throughput (15 PFLOPS dense, +67% vs B200), making it the optimal choice for large-scale LLM inference workloads. FP32/FP16/BF16/FP8 performance remains on par with B200.

## Blackwell Ultra Architecture Key Parameters (sm_103)

These parameters influence optimization decisions:

### Execution Units

| Parameter | Value | Impact |
|------|------|------|
| Compute Capability | 10.3 (`sm_103`) | Blackwell Ultra data center / inference-optimized |
| Warp size | 32 threads | 32 threads per warp |
| CUDA Cores per SM | 128 | Basis for FP32/INT32/element-wise throughput |
| Tensor Cores per SM | 4 (5th gen, enhanced FP4) | Enhanced FP4 throughput vs sm_100 |
| RT Cores per SM | 1 (4th gen) | Ray tracing acceleration |
| Register File per SM | 256 KB | Core constraint for register pressure and occupancy |
| Max Registers per Thread | 255 | Register spill threshold |
| L1 / Shared Memory per SM | 128 KB physical pool | L1 and shared memory share physical SRAM |
| Warp Schedulers per SM | 4 | Supports concurrent warp execution |

### Key Differences from SM100 (B200)

| Feature | SM103 (B300 Blackwell Ultra) | SM100 (B200 Blackwell) | Optimization Implication |
|------|------|------|------|
| FP4 Tensor throughput | 15 PFLOPS dense / 20 PFLOPS sparse | 9 PFLOPS dense / 18 PFLOPS sparse | B300 has +67% FP4 dense throughput |
| FP64 CUDA throughput | 1.25 TFLOPS | 37 TFLOPS | B300 NOT suitable for FP64 HPC |
| FP32 CUDA throughput | 37 TFLOPS | 37.5 TFLOPS | ~Same (inference-optimized design) |
| Memory capacity | 288 GB | 192 GB | B300 fits larger models without sharding |
| PCIe generation | Gen 6 | Gen 5 | Higher host-device transfer bandwidth |
| `tcgen05.mma` / UMMA | Supported | Supported | Same Tensor Core instruction path |
| TMEM | Supported | Supported | Accumulators in Tensor Memory |
| TMA | Supported | Supported | Bulk global-to-shared memory transfers |

> **Key Reminder**: `sm_103` is a minor revision of `sm_100`. Kernel code targeting `sm_100` is generally compatible with `sm_103` without modification. The primary difference is significantly enhanced FP4 Tensor Core throughput (15 PFLOPS vs 9 PFLOPS) and expanded memory (288 GB vs 192 GB). FP32/FP16/BF16/FP8 performance is nearly identical between the two.

### Memory Hierarchy

| Level | Size | Bandwidth/Latency | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|
| Registers | 256 KB / SM, up to 255 regs/thread | Fastest | High register pressure rapidly reduces occupancy |
| Shared Memory | 128 KB L1/SMEM physical pool | High throughput | Bank conflicts impact performance |
| L1/TEX Cache | Shares physical SRAM with Shared Memory | Medium | Automatic caching of global loads |
| L2 Cache | 126 MB | Medium | Very large L2 benefits working set locality |
| HBM3e | 288 GB (8 stacks, 12-high) | 8.0 TB/s | 50% more capacity than B200; same bandwidth |

### Tensor Core / MMA Programming Tips

| Type | SM103 Path | Notes |
|------|----------|------|
| FP16 / BF16 GEMM | `tcgen05.mma` (UMMA) | Warp-group level MMA with TMEM accumulators |
| TF32 GEMM | `tcgen05.mma` (UMMA) | TF32 path with FP32 accumulate |
| FP8 / FP6 GEMM | Block-scaled UMMA | Handle scale factors; FP6 support added in sm_103 |
| FP4 GEMM | NVFP4 / MXFP4 enhanced UMMA | Primary inference target; +67% throughput vs sm_100 |
| Attention / FA | Dedicated SM103 UMMA fast path | Leverage TMEM for persistent accumulators |

## Roofline Analysis Assistance

### Computing Arithmetic Intensity

```
AI = FLOPs / Bytes_transferred
```

### Identifying Bottlenecks

```
if AI < (peak TFLOPS / peak_bandwidth TB/s):
  -> Memory Bound (bandwidth bottleneck)
  -> optimization: improve data reuse, tiling, L2 locality, reduce memory traffic
otherwise:
  -> Compute Bound (compute bottleneck)
  -> optimization: maximize Tensor Core utilization, reduce stalls, tune occupancy
```

**Typical Ridge Points**:

| GPU | Precision | Ridge Point (FLOPs/Byte) |
|-----|------|--------------------------|
| B300 | FP16/BF16 Tensor | 2,250 / 8.0 ≈ **281.25** |
| B300 | FP8 Tensor | 4,500 / 8.0 ≈ **562.5** |
| B300 | FP4 Tensor | 15,000 / 8.0 ≈ **1,875** |
| B300 | FP32 CUDA | 37 / 8.0 ≈ **4.6** |
| B300 | TF32 Tensor | 1,100 / 8.0 ≈ **137.5** |

> **Optimization Implication**: The B300's FP4 ridge point of 1,875 FLOPs/Byte is extremely high, meaning FP4 GEMM kernels need very high arithmetic intensity to become compute-bound. For FP4 inference workloads, ensure large tile sizes and maximum data reuse to approach peak throughput. The 288 GB HBM3e capacity allows serving very large models (e.g., 405B parameter models) with fewer GPUs, reducing inter-node communication overhead.

## How to Choose Peak Compute

1. **Identify the primary compute type**: What computation dominates the kernel?
   - Tensor Core / MMA intensive → use FP16/BF16/FP8/FP4 Tensor Core TFLOPS/TOPS
   - Element-wise / reduction intensive → use FP32 CUDA Core TFLOPS
   - Memory-bound transport / quant epilogue intensive → prioritize bandwidth roofline, not Tensor Core peak
   - ⚠️ Do NOT use FP64 for HPC workloads on B300 (1.25 TFLOPS only)
2. **Identify the target GPU**:
   - B300 → use 37 FP32, 2,250 BF16, 4,500 FP8, 15,000 FP4, 8.0 TB/s
3. **Mixed compute**: If the kernel has both Tensor Core computation and element-wise epilogue, compute separate rooflines for the mainloop and epilogue; do not use a single peak to mask bottlenecks.
4. **Source priority**: NVIDIA official Blackwell Ultra datasheet, NVIDIA developer blog, DGX B300 user guide, and Blackwell tuning guide.
